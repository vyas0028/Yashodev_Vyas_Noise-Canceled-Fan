# Noise Canceling Fan Repository Guide

A desktop fan that actively reduces its own noise using real-time noise cancellation. This project combines CAD, embedded programming, signal processing, and acoustic analysis to showcase the engineering process from start to finish and create a standalone product! 

---

## What It Does
This fan detects its own blade-generated noise using a microphone, identifies the dominant frequency using an FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), and cancels it in real time by outputting an inverted sound through a speaker.

| [Box](CAD/Project_CAD/box.SLDPRT)                                 |   Box that forms the base. Houses electronics.   
| [Lid](CAD/Project_CAD/lid.SLDPRT)                                 |   Lid that fits flush with top of base. Mounts to support tube with screws.  
| [Support_Tube](CAD/Project_CAD/tube.SLDPRT)                       |   Vertical support tube that rises from lid to shroud. Houses wiring.   
| [Fan_Housing_Front_Plate](CAD/Project_CAD/Fan_Front_Plate.SLDPRT) |   Circular plate that sits in front of fan to create circular profile to fit into shroud.   
| [Fn_Housing_Back_Plate](CAD/Project_CAD/Fan_Back_Plate.SLDPRT)    |   Circular plate that sits in behind fan to create circular profile to fit into shroud.   
| [Fan_Shroud](CAD/Project_CAD/Shroud.SLDPRT)                       |   Horizontal cylinder that houses fan, microphone, and speaker. Connects to support tube at bottom.      
| [Final_Assembly](CAD/Project_CAD/Final_Assembly.SLDPRT) |   Final assembly of shroud, tubewith holes, lid, and base.
